# Introduction 
The title and authors are included in the LaTeX preamble, but everything that follows is written in markdown, including references and figures. 

This is my introduction. This section automatically received the label `introduction`.  I can cite references in parentheses [see @bainbridgeResiliencyImageMemorability2020]. My favorite paper is @adrianBergerRhythmPotential1934. I can crossref to Figure \ref{paleblue} in section \ref{introduction}.
